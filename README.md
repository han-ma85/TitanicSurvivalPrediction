# TitanicSurvivalPrediction
In this repository I tried to predict if someone survived the Titanic shipwreck using all the classification algorithms(Logistic Regression,Decision Tree,Random Forest,SVM,KNN,XGBOOST,Voting Classifier).Also performed hyper parameter tuning

In this notebook, I hope to show how a data scientist would go about working through a problem. The goal is to correctly predict if someone survived the Titanic shipwreck. I thought it would be fun to see how well I could do in this compention without deep learning.



Steps Involved:
1) Understand the shape of the data (Histograms, box plots, etc.)
2) Data Cleaning
3) Data Exploration
4) Feature Engineering
5) Data Preprocessing for Model
6) Basic Model Building
7) Model Tuning
8) Ensemble Modle Building
9) Results
