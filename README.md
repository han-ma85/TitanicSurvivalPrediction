# TitanicSurvivalPrediction
In this notebook I tried to predict if someone survived the Titanic shipwreck using all the classification algorithms(Logistic Regression,Decision Tree,Random Forest,SVM,KNN,XGBOOST,Voting Classifier).Also performed hyper parameter tuning




Steps Involved:
1) Understand the shape of the data (Histograms, box plots, etc.)
2) Data Cleaning
3) Data Exploration
4) Feature Engineering
5) Data Preprocessing for Model
6) Basic Model Building
7) Model Tuning
8) Ensemble Modle Building
9) Results
